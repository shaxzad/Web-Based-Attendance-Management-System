# Deployment Rules

## Docker Configuration
- Use multi-stage builds for optimization
- Use specific version tags for base images
- Implement proper health checks
- Use non-root users in containers
- Optimize layer caching

## Environment Configuration
- Use .env files for local development
- Use environment variables in production
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use different configurations for dev/staging/prod
- Validate environment variables on startup

## CI/CD Pipeline
